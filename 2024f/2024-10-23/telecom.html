<p>“I don’t think it was an invention… It was a collection of ideas that
were around at the time. The computer people had always had blocks, and
lines were always around; that was nothing new … the real issue was to
carry through and see that it was important and it was economic and it
was going to have an influence and make sure it happened.”</p>

<h2>Strachey’s Time-Sharing</h2>
<ul>
<li>In 1959, “time-sharing” emerged—arguably from multiple sources
(McCarthy, 1983).</li>
<li>In today’s language, we may refer to it more like
<strong>interrupt-based multiprocessing</strong>.

<h2>Strachey on “Interactivity”</h2>
<ul>
<li>It’s still batch processing, focused on debugging batch
calculations.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>“There will be three operator’s consoles: an engineer’s console for
maintaining and testing the machine, a programme-testing console with
various visual displays and at least an electric typewriter, and a main
operator’s console. All three will have fairly extensive facilities for
intervening in the course of a calculation.”</p>
<p>Christopher Strachey (Strachey, 1959)</p>
</blockquote>
<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>Strachey’s time-sharing (Strachey, 1959) was more like concurrent
batch processing. In his time, I/O devices would perform complex
(expensive!) operations to read and write data from magnetic tape while
the main computer had to wait. Now “interrupts” entered the lexicon,
which caught on. As the cost of computing was driven down by the
development of electronics, devices could be categorized as slow or
fast; simple or complex.

maintaining and testing the machine, a programme-testing console with

intervening in the course of a calculation.” - Christopher Strachey,
“Time Sharing in Large Fast Computers”</li>

believe I mentioned the idea to anyone before I heard of them from other
sources.” - John McCarthy, Reminisces on the Theory of Time-Sharing</li>

<section id="changes-in-interactivity" class="slide level2">
<h2>Changes in Interactivity</h2>
<ul>
<li>In 1962, just a few years after Strachey, time-sharing started to be
about interactivity, a new principle concurrent with time-sharing.
Again, the focus was on debugging.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="debugging" class="slide level2">
<h2>Debugging</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“Using current batch monitor techniques, as is done on most large
computers, each program bug usually requires several hours to eliminate,
if not a complete day. The only alternative presently available is for
the programmer to attempt to debug directly at the computer, a process
which is grossly wasteful of computer time and hampered seriously by the
poor console communication usually available. Even if a typewriter is
the console, there are usually lacking the sophisticated query and
response programs which are vitally necessary to allow effective
interaction.”</p>
<p>Corbató et al. (Corbató et al., 1962)</p>

<section id="talking-to-your-computer" class="slide level2">
<h2>Talking to Your Computer</h2>
<ul>
<li>In the 1960s, human computer interaction shifted from “operating a
machine” to “having a phone call”.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>“The effect of this time-sharing is to allow a
<strong>conversation</strong> between the user and the computer, at
speeds suitable to the user, and this proves to be one of the most
significant features, giving the system great versatility. One effect of
this conversational mode of operation is that most interactions involve
very small amounts of computer time.”</p>

<li>Inter-“networked”</li>
</ul>
<!-- CUT FOR HISTORY -->
<!--
## ARPA's Start
- The Advanced Research Projects Agency's (ARPA) Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO) wanted to connect universities supported by its funding. 
- Larry Roberts deployed a 1200 bps phone line to connect two areas of Lincoln Labs, and everything worked well enough—except for the network itself, which was slow and unreliable. Getting around that constraint signified the main thrust of the ARPANET project.

## BBN's Start

- In order to deploy a capable network, ARPA contracted Bolt, Beranek, and Newman (BBN) for the job.
- To this end they develoeped the IMP, a ruggedized Honeywell mini-computer with telephone modems attached.

<h2>Architecting the ARPANET</h2>
<ul>
<li>Architectural paradigms in the 60s-70s were dominated by the
<strong>Master/Slave</strong> OS paradigm.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>“You try to connect two such devices together, two computers
together, and they only know how to talk to each other as if one is the
master. Well, if one is the master, then the other must be the slave. We
knew that we wanted a much more flexible vision in which the initiative
could be at either site, and there would be a coordinated or cooperative
model of communications.”</p>

<h2>RFC 33</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>After a sending HOST has sent a message to a receiving HOST over a
particular link, the sending HOST is prohibited from sending another
message over that same link until the sending HOST receives a RFMN. The
RFNM is generated by the IMP connected to the receiving HOST, and the
RFNM is sent back to the sending HOST after the message has entered the
receiving HOST. It is important to remember that there are 356 links in
each direction and that <strong>no relationship among these is imposed
by the network.</strong></p>

<section id="packet-switched" class="slide level2">
<h2>“Packet-Switched”</h2>
<ul>
<li>ARPANET was formally packet-switched, but did not support the
conventions we tend to associated with packet-switched networks. It
established reliable physical circuits that would acknowledge each
message over an unreliable network.</li>
</ul>

<p>“… at each node, a copy of the message is stored until it is safely
received at the following node.”</p>

<h2>Kleinrock on Working with BBN</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“In the early days, when they came out with their proposal, we looked
in their routing algorithm, which we were very interested in, and said:
‘This thing has loops. A packet can go back and forth, or in a circle.’
And they said: ‘No, there are no loops.’ But there are loops! They said:
‘No.’ So we simulated them and said: ‘Look, there’s loops.’ They said:
‘There are no loops.’ Then this four node network was implemented and we
showed them loops, and the answer was; ‘Yes, there are loops.’”</p>

<p>“[BBN] understood that I intended to build another network but they
really didn’t believe it. They had this feeling that the ARPANET, this
kind of complicated system, could only be implemented in a country like
the States due to money, expertise and so on. They didn’t believe Europe

it, it had to be datagrams because that required less of a network and
you had to do things end-to-end anyway, because you wanted to have the
mainframes assure the other end that they had really gotten the data,

<h2>Pouzin on Layering</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“The second thing is [TCP version 1] mingled – it actually handled in
the very same protocol, matters that belong to the transport level, and
matters that belong to the end-to-end protocol. That kind of coupling
was politically unacceptable, because these two levels of system were
handled by two different worlds: The PTTs and the other world, the
computer people. So obviously it was not acceptable in terms of
technical sociology. You could not sell something that involves the
consensus of these two different worlds.”</p>

<p>“With experience gradually building up, and depending on trends in
international standards, more stable characteristics will eventually
