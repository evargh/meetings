were around at the time. The computer people had always had blocks, and
lines were always around; that was nothing new … the real issue was to
carry through and see that it was important and it was economic and it
was going to have an influence and make sure it happened.”</p>

## Development in Electronics

- As microelectronics became **cheaper and more reliable**, a distinction emerged:
  - **I/O**: slow, complex, prone to mechanical failure
  - **Mainframe**: fast, simple, less prone to mechanical failure

## Strachey's Time-Sharing

- In 1959, "time-sharing" emerged—arguably from multiple sources (McCarthy, 1983). 
- In today's language, we may refer to it more like **interrupt-based multiprocessing**. 
  - Slow I/O could **interrupt** the mainframe whenever it was done with its task.

## Strachey on "Interactivity"

- It's still batch processing, focused on debugging batch calculations.

> "There will be three operator's consoles: an engineer's console for maintaining and testing the machine, a programme-testing console with various visual displays and at least an electric typewriter, and a main operator's console. All three will have fairly extensive facilities for intervening in the course of a calculation."
>
> Christopher Strachey (Strachey, 1959)

::: {.notes}
- Strachey's time-sharing (Strachey, 1959) was more like concurrent batch processing. In his time, I/O devices would perform complex (expensive!) operations to read and write data from magnetic tape while the main computer had to wait. Now "interrupts" entered the lexicon, which caught on. As the cost of computing was driven down by the development of electronics, devices could be categorized as slow or fast; simple or complex.
    - "There will be three operator's consoles: an engineer's console for maintaining and testing the machine, a programme-testing console with various visual displays and at least an electric typewriter, and a main operator's console. All three will have fairly extensive facilities for intervening in the course of a calculation." - Christopher Strachey, "Time Sharing in Large Fast Computers"
    - "Who invented interrupts anyway? I thought of them, but I don't believe I mentioned the idea to anyone before I heard of them from other sources." - John McCarthy, Reminisces on the Theory of Time-Sharing
:::

## Changes in Interactivity

- In 1962, just a few years after Strachey, time-sharing started to be about interactivity, a new principle concurrent with time-sharing. Again, the focus was on debugging.

## Debugging

> "Using current batch monitor techniques, as is done on most large computers, each program bug usually requires several hours to eliminate, if not a complete day. The only alternative presently available is for the programmer to attempt to debug directly at the computer, a process which is grossly wasteful of computer time and hampered seriously by the poor console communication usually available. Even if a typewriter is the console, there are usually lacking the sophisticated query and response programs which are vitally necessary to allow effective interaction."

<h2>Talking to Your Computer</h2>
<ul>
<li>In the 1960s, human computer interaction shifted from factory
machine to having a phone call.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>“The effect of this time-sharing is to allow a
<strong>conversation</strong> between the user and the computer, at
speeds suitable to the user, and this proves to be one of the most
significant features, giving the system great versatility. One effect of
this conversational mode of operation is that most interactions involve
very small amounts of computer time.”</p>

<h2>ARPA’s Start</h2>
<ul>
<li>The Advanced Research Projects Agency’s (ARPA) Information

supported by its funding.</li>
<li>Larry Roberts deployed a 1200 bps phone line to connect two areas of
Lincoln Labs, and everything worked well enough—except for the network
itself, which was slow and unreliable. Getting around that constraint
signified the main thrust of the ARPANET project.</li>

<h2>BBN’s Start</h2>
<ul>

<h2>Architecting the ARPANET</h2>
<ul>
<li>Architectural paradigms in the 60s-70s were dominated by the
“Master/Slave” OS paradigm.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>“You try to connect two such devices together, two computers
together, and they only know how to talk to each other as if one is the
master. Well, if one is the master, then the other must be the slave. We
knew that we wanted a much more flexible vision in which the initiative
could be at either site, and there would be a coordinated or cooperative
model of communications.”</p>

<h2>RFC 33</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>After a sending HOST has sent a message to a receiving HOST over a
particular link, the sending HOST is prohibited from sending another
message over that same link until the sending HOST receives a RFMN. The
RFNM is generated by the IMP connected to the receiving HOST, and the
RFNM is sent back to the sending HOST after the message has entered the
receiving HOST. It is important to remember that there are 356 links in
each direction and that <strong>no relationship among these is imposed
by the network.</strong></p>

<section id="packet-switched" class="slide level2">
<h2>“Packet-Switched”</h2>
<ul>
<li>ARPANET was formally packet-switched, but did not support the
conventions we tend to associated with packet-switched networks. It
established reliable physical circuits that would acknowledge each
message over an unreliable network.</li>
</ul>

<section id="kleinrock-on-working-with-bbn" class="slide level2">
<h2>Kleinrock on Working with BBN</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“In the early days, when they came out with their proposal, we looked
in their routing algorithm, which we were very interested in, and said:
‘This thing has loops. A packet can go back and forth, or in a circle.’
And they said: ‘No, there are no loops.’ But there are loops! They said:
‘No.’ So we simulated them and said: ‘Look, there’s loops.’ They said:
‘There are no loops.’ Then this four node network was implemented and we
showed them loops, and the answer was; ‘Yes, there are loops.’”</p>

<section id="the-end-of-arpanet" class="slide level2">
<h2>The End of ARPANET</h2>
<ul>
<li>An incomplete conclusion could be that the ARPANET was doomed to
fail.
<ul>
<li>Built off phone lines</li>
<li>Designed explicitly for reliable routing</li>
<li>Built with non-transparent gateways</li>
</ul></li>
<li>However, you could alternatively say that the opposition created
between BBN and the academic community, as well as BBN’s own confused
organization and strained relatioship to ARPA, stunted the possibility
of ARPANET’s full development.</li>

<section id="other-influences" class="slide level2">
<h2>Other influences</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Not directly continuous.</p></li>
<li><p>CYCLADES, a project by the French postal service, headed by Louis
Pouzin, tried to finish what appeared lacking in ARPANET &gt; “[BBN]
understood that I intended to build another network but they really
didn’t believe it. They had this feeling that the Arpanet, this kind of
complicated system, could only be implemented in a country like the
States due to money, expertise and so on. They didn’t believe Europe
could bring something like that up.” &gt; &gt; Louis Pouzin</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="layering-in-cyclades" class="slide level2">
<h2>Layering in CYCLADES</h2>
<ul>
<li>CYCLADES was an intervening force for whom we now credit as the
inventors of TCP/IP - Cerf, Kahn, and Metcalfe. CYCLADES had explicit
layering by modeling to an application an end-to-end virtual circuit on
top of an unreliable, best-effort network. With CYCLADES, modern
networking concepts become recognizable</li>
<li>Later, we would see the protocol wars come out of these
delineations.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="end-to-end" class="slide level2">
<h2>End-to-End?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Why be end-to-end?
<ul>
<li>End-to-end provisioning is useful in that they only need to fix a
problem once, at the host, and the host is the device most able to
appraise what an error is. Pouzin remained open to alternative
solutions: “With experience gradually building up, and depending on
trends in international standards, more stable characteristics will
eventually emerge. By putting them at some lower system level, it will
be possible to obtain higher efficiency and reduce duplication, at the
cost of freezing a few more parameters.”</li>
<li>However, end-to-end solutions are slow, and not every problem that
manifests at the host is more easily solved at the host–(e.g. the rapid
adoption of ECN).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Why use virtual circuits?
<ul>
<li>To Pouzin, freedom in routing packets.</li>
<li>“Although various groups call for a DG [datagram] interface, the
carriers are opposed to it. Four carriers are rushing a VC [virtual
circuit, to Pouzin this means an exclusively carrier-operated network
that requires user subscription to that network] protocol through CCITT
[Consultative Committee for International Telephony and Telegraphy, a
committee in the International Telegraphers Union]. The carrier’s goal
is to take over terminal handling, and gradually other processing
functions. DG’s would leave too much freedom to the customer. The
political implications of the carrier policy suggest that better
boundaries be drawn up between carriers and data processing.”</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="conclusion" class="slide level2">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<ul>
<li>Hopefully, this presentation has illustrated that the development of
the (more or less) modern internet was not just a rational adoption of
design principles, but rather a process that was marked by nuclear war,
academic contention, disorganization, and political visions for an ideal
internet.</li>
<li>Apparent “givens” in design like the end-to-end principle and
layering were contingents of a decades-long development in
human-computer interaction.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="discussion" class="slide level2">
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<ul>
<li>Is the end-to-end principle still applicable?</li>
<li>What assumptions made by early designers ended up violated over
time, if any?</li>
<li>Can the internet realistically be changed? If so, to what
extent?</li>
